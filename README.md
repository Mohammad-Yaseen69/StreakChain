## What is StreakChain?

StreakChain is a small, opinionated CLI app made for people who want to build habits by tracking streaks. Each logged day awards XP. XP accumulates into levels ‚Äî complete with titles and celebratory messages when you level up.

It was built with a focus on small wins and consistent progress.

## Tiny contract

- Inputs: interactive prompts via the terminal (create streak name, description, duration, and daily logs).
- Outputs: updates to the local JSON database (`db/db.json`), terminal display (XP, levels, streaks), and optional packaged executable.
- Error modes: missing/invalid input is validated by prompts; database write failures will surface as runtime errors.
- Success: XP and streaks persisted; level-ups displayed and saved in `db.data.levelUpHistory`.

## Install (recommended for users)

The easiest way for end users to install StreakChain is globally via npm. This exposes a `streakchain` command in your shell.

PowerShell (run as normal user):

```powershell
# install globally from the npm 
npm install -g streakchain

# then start StreakChain with:
streakchain
```

Notes:
- If you install globally from the local folder (`npm install -g .\`), ensure you ran `npm run build` first so `dist/` exists.
- When published to npm, users can install with `npm install -g streakchain` and then run `streakchain`.

## Install (developer)

Make sure you have Node.js (recommended v16+) and npm installed.

PowerShell example (developer workflow):

```powershell
# install deps
npm install

# Run in dev mode (uses ts-node ESM loader)
npm run dev

# Build TypeScript to JS
npm run build

# Run compiled build
node dist/index.js
```

## Quick usage

- Start the app and follow the prompts to create a new streak, log today's streak, or view level details.

Example (after building):

```powershell
node dist/index.js
```

Or during development:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

If you installed globally (recommended for users) or linked the package, start it with:

```powershell
streakchain
```

### User usage (typical flows)

This section shows common interactive flows an end user will experience after running `streakchain`.

- Main menu: choose actions with arrow keys (Log Today's Streak, View Your Streaks, Create a Streak, Delete a Streak, Level & Progress, About StreakChain, Exit).

- Create a streak flow:
	1. Select "Create a Streak" from the main menu.
	2. Enter a name (e.g. "Coding").
	3. Enter a specific purpose (e.g. "Learn new concepts every day").
	4. Enter duration in days (e.g. 30).
	5. You will see a confirmation box and the streak is added to your DB.

- Log today's streak flow:
	1. Select "Log Today's Streak".
	2. Choose the streak(s) you completed today.
	3. XP is awarded and the app checks for level ups. If you level up you'll see a celebration box in the terminal.

- View level & progress:
	1. Select "Level & Progress" to see your current XP, level, progress bar, statistics, and the level requirements table.

- Missed streaks:
	- If a streak is missed (no log for yesterday and not created today), the streak resets and XP may be removed according to the streak settings.

These flows are interactive ‚Äî follow the prompts shown in the terminal. Use ESC or Ctrl+C to exit at any time.

## Packaging as a standalone executable

This project includes `pkg` in `package.json` and a `bin` entry. Example packaging command (Windows):

```powershell
# from repo root
pkg . --targets node16-win-x64 --output streakchain.exe
```

The `pkg` config in package.json already includes `dist/**/*.js` and `dist/**/*.json` in assets. Build first (`npm run build`) so `dist/` is populated.

## Level System (summary)

StreakChain uses an XP requirement array for levels. Below are the first levels and their titles:

| Level | XP Required | Title |
|-------:|-----------:|:------|
| 1 | 0 | üå± Beginner |
| 2 | 100 | üìö Learner |
| 3 | 250 | üí™ Dedicated |
| 4 | 450 | üî• Consistent |
| 5 | 700 | ‚≠ê Rising Star |
| 6 | 1000 | üèÜ Achiever |

There are many more levels (up to 50) with growing XP requirements ‚Äî see `src/utils/levelSystem.ts` for the full table and titles.

## Where data is stored

- The app uses a small JSON DB at `src/db/db.json` (bundled to `db.json` in the repo root). This file stores streaks, XP totals, and level-up history.

Important: Back it up if you want to preserve your progress across machines.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few simple ways to help:

- Report issues or suggest features.
- Improve CLI copy, messages, or UX.
- Add tests or CI, or add more screenshot examples.

If you'd like, I can also prepare a GitHub Actions workflow for packaging and releasing binaries automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- If the CLI doesn't start in dev mode, ensure `ts-node` and `typescript` are installed (`npm install`).
- If you get permission issues when using `npm link`, run the PowerShell as Administrator or install the packaged executable.
