StreakChain is a CLI tool built to help you stay ${chalk.greenBright.bold("consistent")} 
and ${chalk.yellowBright.bold("disciplined")}. I created this tool for myself because I used to struggle 
with consistency and had some bad habits. Thanks to StreakChain's gamification system, 
I can trick my brain to stay consistent and build discipline over time.

üìú Rules of StreakChain:
.5. Log your streak every day (no excuses).
2. Missing a day resets your streak to 0 and you lose all XP from that streak.
3. Every log earns you XP ‚Äî consistency = growth.
4. Level up as you accumulate XP.
5. The goal is simple: build discipline, one streak at a time.
